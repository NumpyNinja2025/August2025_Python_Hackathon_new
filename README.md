Use the reference doc to compare your final questions with the examples given. We also recommend peer review using the grading rubrics given in the document.
The files are numbered to make it easy to find what you need, but if you still have questions, use the file index to understand what each file does.
Within each file, look for comments in 'red' to read evaluators remarks. They don't exist in every file, but we've allowed you see our mistakes, so that you can learn from them.
